A keylogger, short for "keystroke logger," is a tool that records every keystroke made on a keyboard. It's often used to monitor and log user activity on a computer. While keyloggers can have legitimate uses, such as monitoring employee activity (with their consent) or recovering lost data, they are frequently associated with malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers.

*Types of Keyloggers*:
1. *Hardware Keyloggers*: Physical devices plugged into the keyboard or computer that log keystrokes.
2. *Software Keyloggers*: Programs that run on the computer, capturing and storing keystrokes.

*Ethical Considerations*:
- Always obtain explicit consent before using a keylogger.
- Misusing keyloggers for unauthorized access to information is illegal and unethical.

*Legitimate Uses*:
- Parental control to monitor children's computer usage.
- Corporate security for monitoring employee activity with consent.
- Recovering lost data or tracking errors in data entry.

Keyloggers have significant privacy implications, so it's crucial to use them responsibly and transparently.
